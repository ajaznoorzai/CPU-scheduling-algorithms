# CPU-scheduling-algorithms


The aim of this is to investigate the performance of different CPU scheduling algorithms. Will use a discrete event simulator to conduct experiments on different processor loads and schedulers, and analyse the results to determine in which situations each scheduling algorithm works most efficiently.
